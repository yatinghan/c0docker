# C0 Dockerfile

## Warning
This is only supposed to last until Iliano wakes up on 10/28/2020, Eastern Standard time. 

The docker image uses an older version of c0. It should be enough to get you through tonight. We will get back to you tomorrow regarding accessibility issues.

This guide could take longer than 30 minutes to complete. It's absolutely not required.

Even if you choose to proceed, please do not submit until you are reconnected to AFS. In fact, the autolab commands will not work in this container.
